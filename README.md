# Genevieve Naa Teteley Quarshie - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me

Hi, I'm Genevieve!
I'm a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

With hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, Advanced Excel, and Python, Iâ€™ve developed dashboards, automated reports, and conducted data analysis that directly supports business goals. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to using data to uncover trends, optimize performance, and solve real-world problems.

I hold a PL-300: Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification and have contributed to impactful projects across sales analytics, environmental data analysis, financial performance tracking, and process optimization.

Alongside my technical skills, I bring a detail-oriented and solution-driven mindset. Whether itâ€™s writing Business Requirements Documents (BRDs), managing tasks with DevOps, or handling customer tickets via SysAid, I value collaboration, continuous learning, and clear communication.

In my free time, I enjoy diving into new datasets, building dashboards, and learning new tools that make data storytelling even more powerful.
